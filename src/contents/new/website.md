Terms: `PSH-Nuxt`(actual website), `PSH-Atro`(new website)

## Table of contents

## Current status

The actual PSH website (`PSH-Nuxt`) was released in mid 2022. It has new sections like for example a FAQ page, and lean towards a greater usage of whatsapp. Despite these changes, the look and feel is outdated and the sitemap (the pages and how they are organized) is lacking a proper logic.

Before `PSH-Nuxt`, the website had been created via a google website tool.

Designing is hard and it would take a lot of skills to develop a complete and coherent design system. That's why, for `PSH-Nuxt` and `PSH-Astro`, a template has been used as a coherent starter.

The design of the `PSH-Astro` website is more modern than `PSH-Nuxt`, but not much work has been done yet to improve the sitemap. We can still notice the arrival of a CTA (Call To Action) section and a banner that tells the customer that booking direct is cheaper.

## Strategic options

Some decisions have already been taken and are under fierce development:

- Make the website accessible in 3 languages: english, spanish and french
- Add a blog section with articles about Edinburgh
- Make use of a CMS (Content Management System) to untie the content part from the coding part, allowing the content manager to have more freedom and independance in his work.

Yet we are still unhappy about the overall look (like for example the hero section) and the sitemap. A proper reflexion is needed on this subject.

The website might be lacking of an intention, of a clear positioning, branding, etc. We need also to work on these matters but at the same time, we must deliver. And so we should decide what are the expectations for a first releasead version of the new website (`PSH-Astro`) and an approximative release date.

Although we may take another approach by taking more time before releasing something that suits more our needs. Still, we need to move forward at a steady pace.

## Objectives

In progress:

- Translate the website
- Write few articles for the blog

Move towards:

- A coherent sitemap (e.g. a menu entry about groups)
- A better hero section
- Rethinking the home page (the most viewed) and think about how we want to present the hostel to the customer. A branding reflexion would be appropriate.
- Do we need new pictures (as the one on the website are outdated) ?

We could create a folder/file gathering screenshots and ideas about what we like in the website of our competitors. A google drive folder would be appropriate.
