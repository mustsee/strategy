## Table of contents

## Data collection

Google Analytics collects the following information through the default implementation:

- Number of users
- Session statistics
- Approximate geolocation
- Browser and device information

## Analysis

The data are corrupt and we need to remedy that. 10 persons per day are visiting our website with sessions during approximatively 30 seconds. The main visited page is the home page. It would be nice to see more users from campaings and social networks. Will our content strategy, i.e. adding blog articles, increase the duration of the user engagement (the time spend on the website) ?

## Data for the last 28 day (23/12/2022 to 19/01/2022)

Disclaimer: Numbers below are corrupt because they include our web sessions (example: engagement for our IP address is equal to 5min42s). We will need to remove our IP addresses from tracking.
